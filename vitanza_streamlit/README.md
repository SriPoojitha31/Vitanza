# Vitanza â€” Streamlit Smart Water & Health Dashboard (MVP)

This is a Streamlit-based MVP for **Vitanza**: an integrated prototype for
- GSM-based Water Level Monitoring (simulated)
- Urban Riverfront Monitoring (water quality + waste alerts)
- Health Surveillance & Early Warning (simple ML demo)

## Quick start
```bash
cd vitanza_streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The app uses simulated IoT data (dummy GSM-like streams) and simple ML rules for demonstration.
